Solution of code challenge
==========================

This repository is a solution of code challenge proposed by
[@lefty313](https://github.com/lefty313) on
[gist](https://gist.github.com/lefty313/8cc3bb916c6d0b5a266eee3a1101dc96#file-codetask-md).

Docker
------

This project uses [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and docker-compose to run the application,
so the developer needs to have the docker installed with docker compose
to run.

To start the server, just run on terminal.

```sh
docker-compose up
```

And the API will be served on port 4567. Access on your browser `http://localhost:4567`.
